# Titanic Challenge - Kaggle

A problem in Machine Learning - finding a suitable model to accurately predict who survived and who didn't survive during the infamous Titanic shipwreck.

1. train.csv - training set;
2. test.csv - set to make predictions on;
3. Kaggle_Titanic.ipynb - jupyter notebook with code;
4. Kaggle_Titanic_utls.py - custom library with some functions for the notebook;
5. gender_submission.csv - an example of what a submission file should look like. 

This is originally a Kaggle competition ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview)).
